Power, Eishkom

lets' say Mdupi cost R128bn (its going to be more than this with all the delays, at the moment R150bn and rising)
One tesla Powerwall battery cost R42000.00 ($3500.00 for 10KWh)
thus we could buy 3.2M tesla batteries for this money. (2KW continuous each)
with a total supply shifting capability of 6.4GW (mdupi total base load 4.8GW.)
