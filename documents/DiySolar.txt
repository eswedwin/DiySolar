DiySolar Idea: 
a) New arm cortexM4 processors
	1) Uses CENELEC B & C or FCC band ITU G.9903 G3-PLC (power-line communications) for sync & SCADA functions.
	2) Do all power conversions needed, extensive use of digital signal processing.
	3) Ethernet IEEE802.3 on Energy Director Gateway modules.

b) Micro inverters to directly convert DC to correct AC for line. (DiySolar-SMI [-BMI] [-WMI] [-ECI])
	1) Standard plug into Mains supply socket on any local circuit. 
		RSA - IEC N-Type.
		DIY, thus much lower installation & maintenance costs.
		2 to 3m leads available
	2) Easy mix and match - actual P&P (plug and play).
	3) All safety in each module, absolute user protection.
		Double insulated for safety.
		Lightning protected - good earthing recommended for user safety.
		Manual boot connection (break-before-make) for standalone start or registering.
		Impedance check for manual start - before power for safety.
		Zero load shut-down for safety. (0.1% minimum load = 2mA)
	4) Any solar voltaic panels can be accommodated and matched.
		MPPC (maximum power point control) via digital control of all conversions.
	5) Series solar voltaic panels combinations possible, limited to maximum power.
	6) Internal power, current and temperature limited.
	7) Default single phase (1ph)
		Times three parallel for three phase (3ph). (See Director below.)
	8) 460W maximum power = 2A in-phase injected into 230V supply.
	9) All communications to cloud, no operator keyboard or display - uses application.
	10) Each unit unique address and completely controllable.
	11) Complete SW solution with automatic reprogramming.
	12) Full access control with 128bit AES encryption throughout.
	13) IP67 enclosures for mounting on panels directly.
	14) 95% efficiency at full power, > 90% at half power.
	15) Each unit continuously monitors currents, voltages in and out
	16) Efficiency, power flow from each unit calculated, accumulated, metered.
	17) Standalone operation - any unit can become master when no director - controls all others.
	18) Automatic configuration to any world standard 50 or 60Hz, 115V or 230V, or 400V 3-phase.

c) Ideal for:
	1) Making hay while the sun shines - literally! 
	2) SOHO (small office,home office) where most of the energy used is during the day.
	3) Small retail when keeping to office/daylight hours.
	4) Small manufacturing (not energy intensive) with lights and small appliances.
	5) 1.8kW to 5.4kW single phase (optimal range).
	6) 5.4kW to 11kW three phase (optimal range).
	7) With incremental installation this can be extended infinitely.
	8) Where grid power unavailable. (Rural Africa.)
	9) Homes with swimming-pools. (Pump runs 8h during day-time.)
	10) Homes with air-conditioning and/or underfloor heating. (Stays on for thermostat control.)

d) Limitations:
	1) Full sun for whole day during winter and summer.
		Position for same power in winter and summer. (Any six months apart) (double sine curve, 6 month period.)
		Use application - calculator to get optimal inclination (angle) for yearly power optimisation.
		Roof mounting optimal for many reasons except for ease of maintenance and installation.
		True North/South facing dependent on latitude. (Always facing equator.)
	2) Usable energy mostly between 9:00 and 15:00 when the above conditions.
	3) Performance dependant on latitude (North-equator-south.)
	4) Big area installation. 
		Maximum power for good commercial panels are 200Wp/m2.
		Small installation of 1.8kW will take at least 10m2. (See costs below.)
	5) 25 years life and 5-6 year payback for solar voltaic panel alone.
	6) Allow for 5% of initial cost as maintenance cost pa. (10% with batteries.)
	7) Batteries more than triple cost and size of installation.
		Doubling the number of panels needed plus the batteries for 12 hours of operation.
		Double the above again for 24h constant load operation with no cloudy backup.
		Batteries have a very limited life of 5 to 7 years and then need replacement.
		Batteries need lots of maintenance and 3 to 4 replacements during life of system.
		The above pushes the lifetime cost to nearly (to more than, dependant on function,) 
			double the initial cost with batteries.
		This can push the payback period to infinity.

b) DiySolar DB Auxiliary External: (not essential, needed for UPS function)
	Install by electrician only.
	Next to DB (distribution board) to control incomer and some loads. 
	Uses Rogowsky coils for easy installation.
	Automatic incomer disconnect/isolation for islanding local supply during outages. (UPS function)
	Automatic sync and reconnect after outage. (No power interruption on reconnect.)
	Check metering for account verification.
	Use PLC communications to Energy Director/Gateway for measurement and control.
	One, two or three additional load switches for load shedding. (independent for better remote control - size ???)
	Could be used for virtual power-station with the above. (See cloud power green energy.) 
	Three units needed for 3-phase. (? communicate via neutral for single interface to director/gateway ?)
	Powered from either the load or grid sides.

	Double insulation to eliminate earth leakage and electrocution risks.
	Start-up/idle power from Line (grid) side.
	Temporary start-up power from the DC side with manual start button. (Used for forced reset/registering also.)

c1) Installation and commissioning instructions:
1) Cover solar voltaic panel so that NO light can reach it. (Use tarpaulin or blanket.) 
	It is deadly dangerous with high DC voltages and currents while exposed to light. 
2) Connect black wire to black terminal by pushing down on connector button, inserting stripped wire and releasing button.
	Connect red wire to red terminal. 
	See step by step sketch 1.
3) Use supplied screws to mount DiySolar module on solar panel frame. 
	Use existing holes and mounting tabs. 
	See sketch 2.
4) Insert plug into mains socket. Switch on when a switched socket used. 
5) Remove solar voltaic panel cover. 
6) Press boot/reset switch on master panel or director to register the new panel in the DiySolar system. 
	(On this panel if its the only one, to make it master.)
7) Operational indication lights: 
	Orange shows Ready status with available power indication.
	Green shows Run status and generating power.
	Both lights off: no power to unit. (Check that it is plugged in and switched on.)
	Orange flashing slowly: Mains connected and on standby.
	Orange and green flashing slowly: Communications and registered, still on standby.
	Orange on and green off: Energy ready for delivery, not registered.
	Green flashing: Rate of flashing equal to energy delivered up to maximum when it stays on.
	Green on and orange flashing: One of the module limits has been reached - protecting mode warning.
